This folder contains the raw data files in .fasta format after unzip. These files are NOT required for subsequent experiments.

Unzip the .zip files in this data folder to have .fasta files. The reason is that the raw .fasta files exceed the 25M maximum file size limit on GitHub. The statistics for the .fasta files are summarized as follows.
